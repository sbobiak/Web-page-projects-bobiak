         When staying in here if youre looking for even more things to do around there is
         a tour that takes you to 4 diffrent haunted spots where real people still haunt
         locations in Florida today, including the spot in the Haunted Cuban Club where 
         a young boy drowned in the Cuban Club pool...but never left. The club isnt just
         haunted by just one boy but a dead actor who committed suicide,according to
         legends did it on stage right in front of an audience and still haunts
         the halls of the club today and if you are lucky enough will witness these 
         spirits when visiting which has happened to many people visiting this haunted
         location.

         Here are some quotes from real life people who have visited The club and their 
         experiences;
         </body>
         
         <li> "It smelled like a thousand dead things as he ranted and raved." </li>
         <li> "He got right in my face, and I could smell his breath."</li>
         <li>"But I no more than got in the bathroom than this crazy suicide actor just
          appears in the mirror, then walks right out of it and into the bathroom.</li>
          <li> "He pauses long enough to look over his shoulder at me."</li>

<body> Dont miss out on this visit because it would be a bad one to skip on your
halloween! </body>
